Cases to think over:

user enters: 5 x 5 =

'=' causes expression to be evaluated and outputs to display.

5 x 5 x <--

top requires that only two operands evaluated at a time (this allows for removing complexity of order of operations), 
I could have it so when an operand, operator operand are placed, they are instantly evaluated

5 x - 5 

this case, I am indicating I am desiring to use a negative number
negative sign is a unary operand in this case

- 5 x - 5 

this is allowed

- 5 x - 5 /

this should evaluate instantly the expression and returning sum with new operator --> 25 / 

how to distinguish unary operator - from binary operator operator -

5 - 5 

is this 5(-5) or 5 - 5 

should be 5 - 5. 

5 =

can single operand be placed and evaluated?
Not in this implementation. Google did implemented tho.

5 x /

/ should replace the operator before it -> x (assuming that the user wants to change the operator).
